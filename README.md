In this Virtual Internship (CodSoft), I work on three exciting web development tasks - a Calculator, a Landing Page, and a Portfolio. Throughout this internship, I gained valuable insights into various aspects of web development and honed my skills in Coding, Design, and Problem-Solving.

The second task was the development of a personal portfolio website. This project allowed me to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. Crafting a visually appealing and functional portfolio involved combining my technical skills with a sense of creativity and individuality. I implemented responsive design techniques and optimized the site for performance. Learning about hosting and domain management added a practical dimension to my web development knowledge.
3. Calculator Task:
The third task involved creating a web-based calculator. This assignment helped me strengthen my foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had to ensure the calculator functioned accurately, providing users with a seamless and intuitive experience.
